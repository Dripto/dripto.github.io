I am a fourth year Physics PhD student studying Quantum Error Correction at Duke University advised by Prof Ken Brown. My interests are in using the structure present in physical error models to increase the performance of near term quantum computers, through error correction, improved gate compilation, or other methods.
<!-- Welcome to my personal site! Iâ€™m a fourth year Physics PhD student at Duke University, advised by Prof. Ken Brown. I work on Quantum Information Theory, specifically on near term quantum error correction and mitigation. My focus is in maximizing the performance of small scale quantum computers through better understanding of physical error models. Our group is focused on ion trap quantum computers, but I am also interested in non-stabilizer codes, near term error detection, and schemes for universal fault tolerance in more general architectures. -->

I grew up in NYC and received my BS in Physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara. While there I worked on experimental and numerical cosmology, and was also a member of the ultimate frisbee team.
