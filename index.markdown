I am a fifth year Physics PhD student studying Quantum Error Correction at Duke University advised by Prof Ken Brown. My interests are in finding ways to take advantage of the structure in physical error models to improve the reliability of near term quantum computers. My work is focused on near term fault-tolerant protocols, improved gate compilation, and development of physical error models.
<!-- Welcome to my personal site! Iâ€™m a fourth year Physics PhD student at Duke University, advised by Prof. Ken Brown. I work on Quantum Information Theory, specifically on near term quantum error correction and mitigation. My focus is in maximizing the performance of small scale quantum computers through better understanding of physical error models. Our group is focused on ion trap quantum computers, but I am also interested in non-stabilizer codes, near term error detection, and schemes for universal fault tolerance in more general architectures. -->

I grew up in NYC and received my BS in Physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara. While there I worked on experimental and numerical cosmology, and was also a member of the ultimate frisbee team.

<!--Teaching

While at Duke, I have been a recitation instructor for PHYS 151L: Mechanics for Engineers and PHYS 152L: Electromagnetism for Engineers, along with being a lab instructor for PHYS 142L: Electromagnetism for Pre-Meds and PHYS 152L: Electromagnetism for Engineers. -->
